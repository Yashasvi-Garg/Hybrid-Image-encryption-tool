# Hybrid-Image-encryption-tool
Encrypting a image to convert it to a hash code or a cipher, to prevent unauthorized access by adversaries using one of the most secure AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA( Rivest, Shamir,Adleman) algorithm.Image encryption using the AES+RSA algorithm is a secure and efficient way of protecting sensitive images from unauthorized access. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that provides strong encryption and fast processing speeds. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is used to securely exchange the symmetric encryption key. By combining these two algorithms, we get a hybrid encryption scheme that provides the benefits of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
